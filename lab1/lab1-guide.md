# Lab 1 - Basic Linux Commands

## Lab overview

In this lab, we are going to overview basic Linux commands for extracting information about the machine we are using, main file system operations, and basics of editing a file.

All the commands will be run using the command line interface (CLI). The CLI is a powerful tool for running applications, inspecting the system status, and configuring a machine.

## Lab instructions

### Starting a shell program

1. Open a terminal application. Double click on the terminal application on the desktop.

2. The terminal opens showing the shell prompt as shown below. The shell allows running commands and applications.

![](../images/lab1_fig2.png)

To run a command, type a command in the shell and press `<Enter>`. For instance, type `date` in the shell and press `<Enter>`. This runs the date command and displays the date and time of the machine.

<!-- ### Run the `date` command -->

```bash
date
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
Sat Jun 15 00:23:42 UTC 2024
```


### 1. Finding help related to a command

For any given command, you can use the `man` command to print the command manual. For instance:

```bash
man date
```

**Output**

       FORMAT controls the output.  Interpreted sequences are:

       %%     a literal %

       %a     locale's abbreviated weekday name (e.g., Sun)

       %A     locale's full weekday name (e.g., Sunday)

       %b     locale's abbreviated month name (e.g., Jan)

       %B     locale's full month name (e.g., January)

       %c     locale's date and time (e.g., Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005)

       %C     century; like %Y, except omit last two digits (e.g., 20)

       %S     second (00..60)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)

       %:z    +hh:mm numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric  time  zone  with  :  to necessary precision (e.g., -04,
              +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.   The  following  op‐
       tional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After  any  flags  comes  an optional field width, as a decimal number;
       then an optional modifier, which is either E to use the locale's alter‐
       nate  representations  if available, or O to use the locale's alternate
       numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human  readable  date  string
       such  as  "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or
       even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating  cal‐
       endar  date,  time of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, rela‐
       tive date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the
       day.   The date string format is more complex than is easily documented
       here but is fully described in the info documentation.

### 2. Running commands as a superuser

To run commands as a superuser, you need to use `sudo`. The `sudo` command allows you to execute a single command with superuser (root) privileges. This is useful for performing administrative tasks that require higher permissions than those of a regular user.

For instance, the following command runs `ls` (which lists directory contents) with superuser mode:

```bash
sudo ls
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures	Templates  thinclient_drives
Documents  Music      Public	Videos
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Using `sudo` runs commands in superuser mode, which allows the command that is executed to change critical configurations and files in the operating system.
> Consequently, best practice for using superuser mode is:
> + Limit the use of the superuser mode to the bare minimum commands that need superuser privileges
> + Only run commands that you trust and fully understand

### 3. Extracting machine information

Several common Linux commands help us extract information about the machine.

#### 3.1 Finding the OS version information
The file `/etc/os-release` contains the operating system information. We can use the `cat` command to print the file content as follows:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS"
VERSION_ID="20.04"
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
VERSION_CODENAME=focal
UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal
```

This output shows that the machine is running a Ubuntu OS system version 20.04.6

#### 3.2 Finding the CPU information
To find the CPU information, you can use the `lscpu` command.

```bash
lscpu
```

#### 3.3 Finding the memory information
To find information about the memory system in a machine and stats about its usage you can read the `/proc/meminfo` file

```bash
less  /proc/meminfo
```
The `less` command prints the file `/proc/meminfo` one page at a time.
The file `/proc/meminfo` contains information about the memory configuration and its usage.

The output shows that this machine has close to 4 GB of memory. Around 2.6 GB is free.

#### 3.4 Processes management 

To find information about the processes running on an operating system, you can use `ps` or `top`.
`ps` is the command to check the process status. The command offers a number of options to display details about processes.

```bash
ps
```

**Output**
```plaintext
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1991 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   3356 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

The output shows the processes that are run by the current user.
The `ps -e -f` command is a variation of the `ps` command in Linux that allows you to display a list of all the processes running on your Linux system in a more detailed format. It provides a full-process listing that includes information such as the process owner, parent process ID, and start time.

```bash
ps -e -f
```

**Output**
```plaintext

A second common command for monitoring processes on a machine is `top`.
It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. Usually, this command shows the system's summary information and the list of processes running. As soon as you run this command, it will open an interactive command mode. The top half portion contains the statistics of processes and resource usage, and the lower half contains a list of the currently running processes. Pressing `q` will simply exit the command mode.

```bash
top
```

- VIRT: Total virtual memory used by the task.
- USER: The user name of the owner of the task.
- %CPU: Represents the CPU usage.
- TIME+: CPU Time, the same as ‘TIME’, but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.
- SHR: Represents the Shared Memory size (kb) used by a task.
- %MEM: Shows the Memory usage of a process.
- RES: How much physical RAM the process is using, measured in kilobytes.
- COMMAND: The name of the command that started the process.

### 4. Basic file system commands

The Linux files and directories are organized in a directory tree. Each directory can contain files or other directories.

#### 4.1 Finding the current working directory
To find the current working directory, use the `pwd` command.

```bash
pwd
```  

**Output** 

```plaintext
/home/seed
```

#### 4.2 Listing directories and files
The `ls` command lists all directories and files in the current directory.

```bash
ls
```

**Output** 
```plaintext
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  thinclient_drives
Documents  Music      Public    Videos
```

#### 4.3 Changing a directory
To change a directory, use the `cd` command followed by the directory name.

```bash
cd <directory_name>
```

The `cd ~` command returns the prompt to the home directory of the user.

```bash
cd ~
```

#### 4.4 Creating a directory
To create a directory, use the `mkdir` command.

```bash
mkdir newDir
```

You can confirm that "newDir" was created by running the `ls` command

```bash
ls
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  newDir
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     thinclient_drives
```

`cd` will change the working directory to `newDir`. `pwd` should confirm that.

```bash
cd newDir
```

```bash
pwd
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
/home/seed/newDir
```



#### 4.5 Creating and reading a file
There are many commands for creating and editing a text file from within the terminal. The easiest one to learn is `nano`.

```bash
nano new_file.txt
```

This command will create a `new_file.txt` if it does not exist, and will open it for editing if it already exists.
The `nano` command opens the file for editing.

![](../images/lab1_fig3.PNG)

At the bottom of the nano window are the available nano commands. ^ means ctrl.
So you can write in the file something like “this is a test”
Then press `<ctrl+x>` to exit
When asked, press `<y>` to save the changes.
Press `<enter>` to confirm the file name.

Use `ls` to confirm that the new file is created.

```bash
ls
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  newDir        thinclient_drives
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     new_file.txt
```

You can use one of the following commands to print the content of a file

```bash
more new_file.txt
```

or 

```bash
cat new_file.txt
```
or

```bash
less new_file.txt
```

**Output** 

```plaintext
this is a test
```

#### 4.6 Managing files

Use `cp` to copy a file.

```bash
cp new_file.txt copy_file.txt
ls
```
This command copies the file `new_file.txt` to a new file `copy_file.txt`
Use `ls` to verify that the file is copied.


**Output** 

```plaintext
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  copy_file.txt  new_file.txt
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     newDir         thinclient_drives
```

You can see that you have two files now: `new_file.txt` and `copy_file.txt`

To delete a file use the `rm` command

```bash
rm new_file.txt
```

Deletes the new_file.txt

Use `ls` to verify that the file is deleted.

**Output** 

```plaintext
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  copy_file.txt  thinclient_drives
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     newDir
```

#### 4.7	Save the Command History to a File
You can save the command history to a file by running the following command:

```bash
history > ~/my_history.txt
```


#### 4.8	Verify the History File
Check the history file you created using the following command to view the history file

```bash
cat ~/my_history.txt
```

#### 4.9	Terminate the Shell Session
Run the following command to exit the shell session

```bash
exit
```
