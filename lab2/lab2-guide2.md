## Lab overview

An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is a computing resource provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows users to create and use virtualized computing instances in the cloud. Azure Virtual Machines enable users to run applications, host websites, and perform various computing tasks without needing to purchase and maintain physical hardware.

In this walkthrough, we will create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal, connect to the virtual machine, install the Apache web server, and test.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create the Linux virtual machine
+ Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine
+ Task 3: Install Apache server and access

Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Task 1: Create the virtual machine

In this task, we will create a **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS** virtual machine. 

1. On the Azure Portal page, in the Search resources, services, and docs (G+/) box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machines (1)**, and then select **Virtual machines (2)** under services.

1. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click **+ Create (1)** and choose **Azure virtual machine (2)**.

    ![](../images/lab1-image2.png) 

1. On the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information (leave the defaults for everything else):

    | Settings | Values |
    |  -- | -- |
    | Subscription | **Accept default subscription** (1)|
    | Resource group | **myRGVM-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** (2) |
    | Virtual machine name | **myVm** (3)|
    | Location | **(US) East US** (4)|
    | Image | **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - x64 Gen2** (5)|
    | Size | **Standard_D2s_v3** (6)|
    | Authentication type| **Password** |
    | Administrator account username | **azureuser** (7)|
    | Administrator account password | **Pa$$w0rd1234** (8)|
    | Inbound port rules  | **Allow select ports** (9)|
    | Select inbound ports | **SSH (22)** and **HTTP (80)** and **HTTPS** (443) (10)|
    |||

    >Note that some of the options may require you to select the **See all** button, located below the dropdown selector, to find the particular option that you need.

    **Important:** You must name your virtual machine **myVm** for your lab to validate successfully.

1. Click **Next : Disks** to switch to the **Disks** tab and in the **OS Disk type** select **Standard HDD** from the dropdown and leave everything else as default and click **Next : Networking**.

1. Within the Networking tab, look for the **Select inbound ports**:

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Select inbound ports | **HTTP (80), SSH (22)** and **HTTPS** (443)|
   
    >**Note:** - Verify that ports 80, 443 and 22 are selected

1. Click **Next : Management** to switch to the **Management** tab and leave everything as default.

1. Click **Next : Monitoring** to switch to the **Monitoring** tab, select the following setting:

    | Settings | Values |
    | -- | -- |
    | Boot diagnostics | **Disable**|
  
1. Leave the remaining defaults and then click the **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.

1. Once Validation is passed click the **Create** button. It can take anywhere from five to seven minutes to deploy the virtual machine.

1. You will receive updates on the deployment page and via the **Notifications** area (the bell icon in the top menu).

## Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine

In this task, we will connect to our new virtual machine using RDP. 

1. Once the deployment is complete, click on **Go to resource** you will be directed to the page of the newly created Virtual Machine.

1. On the virtual machine **Overview** blade, click the **Connect** button and choose the **Connect** from the dropdown.

    >**Note:**: The following directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer.

1. Within the **Connect** page, click on **Select** under **Native SSH**.

   ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](../images/SSH-U.png)

1. Check the terms and conditions and click on **Configure**. Then, copy the SSH command.

    ![Screenshot of the virtual machine properties with the Connect button highlighted. ](../images/SSH-U1.png)

1. Next, open a command prompt terminal application and paste the copied SSH command from previous step.

1. Enter yes when asked if you want to continue connecting, then provide the password(Pa$$w0rd1234) when prompted and click Enter.

1. To ensure that all available updates are applied, run the command
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ``` 

## Task 3:  Install Apache server and access on your new Azure Cloud VM

In this task, install the Apache Web Server and access it.

1. Within the Linux (Ubuntu) VM , run the command
   ```
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```   
1. Return to your browser and copy the public IP address from the Native SSH tab. Then, open a new browser tab, paste the public IP address into the URL text box, and press the Enter key to browse to it. The custom created basic website shows up.

Moreover, by scrolling down, you can explore several tabs that provide detailed information and controls for your virtual machine (VM).

- Properties: Displays the properties of the machine.

![](../images/lab2_fig2.png) 

- Monitoring: Offers comprehensive information, including performance metrics and availability, for example CPU usage, which displays the current CPU usage of the virtual machine (VM); and disk usage, which shows the current disk usage of the VM.
